I got myself a pair of **Superlux HD668Bs** based on a recommendation as a good
value hi-fi headphones. I like them, but they sound a **bit too harsh**
to me, so I decided to make their high-end a bit softer. Quick search showed
me that doing so is a relatively common procedure, so I went for it.

This is what I did:

1) I took the cushions off (look how thin the original foam is)

2) I cut four circles from a **fleece kitchen towel**, I used the yellow kind from
Lidl

3) ... and inserted them between the original foam and the speaker. I used **two
layers** as they are very light and thin

That's it, it's really simple and the results are **quite impressive**, I did not
notice any loss of clarity or quality, but headphones are much **more pleasant** now
and I can use them for much longer periods of time, especially at higher
volume levels.

With the high-end a bit less prominent, mids and lows shine a bit more now,
making the headphones **more balanced**, so they can be used both for listening
music and some home studio mixing, which is what I use them for.

I am pretty sure this can be experimented with - different materials, thicknesses
and layers can be used to achieve different results, so happy hacking!
