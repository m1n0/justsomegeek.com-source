<p>It happens too often that I get disconnected from a shell connection after a while of inactivity with message <code>Write failed: Broken pipe</code>.
To prevent this, simply put:</p>

<pre><code>Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 30
</code></pre>

<p>in your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> (OS X) or <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</code> (Linux) file.</p>

<p>This will make sure that null packet will be sent every 30 seconds (you can edit the interval) to the server to keep the connection alive.</p>
